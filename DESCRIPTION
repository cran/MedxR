Title: Access Drug Regulatory Data via FDA and Health Canada APIs
Version: 0.1.1
Maintainer: Renzo Caceres Rossi <arenzocaceresrossi@gmail.com>
Description: Provides functions to access drug regulatory data from public RESTful APIs 
    including the 'FDA Open API' and the 'Health Canada Drug Product Database API', 
    retrieving real-time or historical information on drug approvals, adverse events, 
    recalls, and product details. Additionally, the package includes a curated collection 
    of open datasets focused on drugs, pharmaceuticals, treatments, and clinical studies. 
    These datasets cover diverse topics such as treatment dosages, pharmacological studies, 
    placebo effects, drug reactions, misuses of pain relievers, and vaccine effectiveness. 
    The package supports reproducible research and teaching in pharmacology, medicine, 
    and healthcare by integrating reliable international APIs and structured datasets 
    from public, academic, and government sources. 
    For more information on the APIs, see: 
    'FDA API' <https://open.fda.gov/apis/> and 
    'Health Canada API' <https://health-products.canada.ca/api/documentation/dpd-documentation-en.html>.
