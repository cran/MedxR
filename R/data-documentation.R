#' The Effects of Caffeine
#'
#' This dataset, caffeine_matrix, is a matrix containing data from Henson et al.
#' [1996] investigating caffeine's effect on short-term visual memory. High school
#' students (9 eighth-graders, 10 tenth-graders, 9 twelfth-graders) were tested
#' twice: once after drinking caffeinated Coke and once after decaffeinated Coke.
#' Students had 10 seconds to memorize 20 common objects, then 1 minute to recall
#' them. The study examined whether students remembered more objects with
#' decaffeinated versus caffeinated Coke.

#' in the R ecosystem. This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
