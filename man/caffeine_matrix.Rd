\description{
This dataset, caffeine_matrix, is a matrix containing data from Henson et al.
[1996] investigating caffeine's effect on short-term visual memory. High school
students (9 eighth-graders, 10 tenth-graders, 9 twelfth-graders) were tested
twice: once after drinking caffeinated Coke and once after decaffeinated Coke.
Students had 10 seconds to memorize 20 common objects, then 1 minute to recall
them. The study examined whether students remembered more objects with
decaffeinated versus caffeinated Coke.
