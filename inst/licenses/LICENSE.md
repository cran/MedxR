## Note on FDA and Health Canada APIs

The `MedxR` package depends on public APIs provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada for accessing drug-related regulatory information. These APIs are publicly accessible and provided for informational and research purposes.

The **FDA API** is part of the openFDA initiative and is made available under an open data policy. No authentication is required for general access, and no attribution is explicitly required by the FDA. For more details, visit the [openFDA website](https://open.fda.gov/) and review their [Terms of Service](https://open.fda.gov/terms/).

The **Health Canada Drug Product Database (DPD) API** is also openly accessible and made available through the Government of Canada's open data platform. Attribution is not strictly required but is encouraged. For further information, see the [Health Canada DPD API documentation](https://health-products.canada.ca/api/documentation/dpd-documentation-en.html) and the [Government of Canada Open Data Licence](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada).
